===============================================


1. Introduction

 This document explains how to install the Call of Duty(tm) Linux server
 version 1.5b. 

 You must have version 1.5 installed before installing 1.5b

 Usage is very similar to Call of Duty(tm) and Return to Castle
 Wolfenstein(tm)... many of the console commands, command lines, and cvars
 are identical.

 MOD USERS: PLEASE READ...
  It is recommended that any user modifications that have been
  installed to the Call of Duty(tm) directory be removed before
  installing this package. These modifications are not supported
  by Activision(r) and may not be compatible with some of the new
  features that are included.

 IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH "LIBSTDC++.SO.5" ...
  (This is a frequent-enough problem to merit discussion in the introduction.)

  If you are reading this, it's probably because you tried to start your Linux
   server and saw this message:

    ./cod_lnxded: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5:
     cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

  Call of Duty(tm) is a C++ program built with gcc 3.2.3, which means it needs a
  system library specific to gcc 3.2. Older Linux systems won't have
  this installed, and we're starting to see newer Linux distributions that
  don't have this either, since they are supplying an incompatible
  gcc 3.4 version. The good news is that you can drop the needed library
  into your system without breaking anything else.

  Here is the library you need, if your Linux distribution doesn't supply it:
    http://icculus.org/updates/cod/gcc3-libs.tar.bz2

  You want to unpack that somewhere that the dynamic linker will see it
  (if you are sure it won't overwrite any files, you can even use /lib).

  The brave can put it in the same directory as the game and run the server
  like this:
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:. ./cod_lnxded

  Now the server will start.


2.Upgrading an existing Call of Duty(tm) Linux server

 You must have 1.5 installed before installing 1.5b.

 - Shutdown your existing Call of Duty(tm) server if it is currently running.
 - Make a backup of your existing Call of Duty(tm) server's directory, just in case.
 - Remove any mods you've installed. Incompatible mods left in an upgraded
   server are among the most frequent bug reports!
 - Unpack this archive in the games directory:
	
	cd /where/i/installed/COD
	tar -xjvvf cod-lnxded-bins-1.5b.tar.bz2

 - Now the server can be restarted, and should function as before, except
   with the new patch fixes and features. You should experiment with readding
   your mods one by one to see if any are incompatible with the new patch.


3. Support Channels

 There are a LOT of knobs to tweak to customize and automate your server,
 but it is beyond the scope of this documentation. Please refer to the
 admin manuals for any Quake 3(tm) based Multiplayer game (including Quake 3
 Arena(tm), Return to Castle Wolfenstein(tm), etc) for specifics.

 There is a mailing list for discussion and support of Call of Duty(tm) and
 Call of Duty(tm): United Offensive(tm) Linux servers. Hundreds of experienced
 server admins and even some of the game's developers monitor this list, and
 are eager to help with politely asked questions. Send a blank email to
 cod-subscribe@icculus.org to get on the list, and list archives can be seen
 at:

   http://icculus.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-cgi?38

 Bug reports should NOT be sent to the list. We have a web-based
 bugtracking system for this. If you don't report bugs there, we don't
 promise to even be aware of them, let alone fix them! You can find the bug
 tracker here:

   https://bugzilla.icculus.org/


4.  FreeBSD users

 This server is known to work on FreeBSD with the Linux binary compatibility
 layer. If it doesn't, we consider it a bug and appreciate the report since we
 won't necessarily be testing on FreeBSD ourselves. Please note, that as of
 version 1.2, the server requires that you use the linux_base-8 package for
 binary compatibility (it has a C++ runtime library we now need that previous
 linux_base packages don't supply...alternately, see notes about libstdc++ in
 this document's introduction if you can't or won't update linux_base).


5. Fixes

 
 This patch resolves an exploit that can be used to crash servers.
